# Voice-Assistant-GPT
"This project creates a voice-activated assistant using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. It listens for a wake word ('Hey'), then captures voice input, sends it to the OpenAI API, and responds with a spoken answer using text-to-speech (TTS). Key features include speech recognition, dynamic responses, and natural conversation handling."
